Tip QR Codes

Tip QR Codes is a lightweight, mobile friendly tip jar built for musicians, bands, and performers who want fast QR codes without apps, logins, or nonsense.

It runs entirely as a static page on GitHub Pages and includes a built in admin mode so any act can customize it on the fly.

What it does
	•	Displays clean, scannable QR codes for tips and links
	•	Built in admin mode for full control
	•	Add unlimited payment or promo links
	•	Edit page title, subtitle, genre, and rotating tip jokes
	•	Choose background themes and visual vibes
	•	Saves settings locally per device
	•	Export and import configs so other acts can reuse it instantly

Admin mode

Open the page with ?admin=1 at the end of the URL.

Example
https://petesimple.github.io/tip-qr-codes/?admin=1

From there you can:
	•	Add, remove, and reorder QR cards
	•	Customize jokes and rotation timing
	•	Switch genres and background styles
	•	Export a config or share a single setup link

Default example

The repo ships with Petesimple links as examples:
	•	Venmo
	•	Cash App
	•	PayPal
	•	Apple Music

These are just defaults. Replace everything and make it yours.

	2.	Go to Settings → Pages
	3.	Source: Deploy from a branch

Why this exists

Because tip jars should be:
	•	Easy to scan
	•	Easy to edit
	•	Easy to reuse
	•	And never require explaining how an app works between songs

Built for merch tables, music stands, tablets, and the gentle chaos of live gigs.
